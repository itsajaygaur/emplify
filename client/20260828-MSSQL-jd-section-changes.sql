/*
  Reviewer edits to the editable Emplify JD elements.

  Education DESIRED, Experience DESIRED and Certification Registration_Licensure
  DESIRED can be edited by Functional Leaders on the Updated panel. The original
  values are parsed from job_descriptions.other_job_description, which stays
  untouched so the Original panel keeps showing the unedited job description.

  section_key matches a key of JobDescriptionSections in
  shared/job-description-fields.ts (e.g. 'educationDesired').

  sort_order >= 0 is a displayed item, in order. A single row with
  sort_order = -1 and an empty item_text marks a section the reviewer has
  deliberately emptied: without it, "saved with no items" and "never edited"
  would both read as "no rows" and deleted items would reappear on reload.
