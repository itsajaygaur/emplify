/* =========================================================================
   Emplify — reviewer bootstrap (OPTIONAL, EDIT BEFORE RUNNING)
   =========================================================================
   The source workbook carries no review state, so job_reviewers starts empty.
   That is a problem in one specific way:

       PUT /api/job-description validates every reviewer in the payload against
       SELECT DISTINCT reviewer FROM job_reviewers, and rejects the save with
       "Please provide valid reviewers!" if a name is not already in there.

   So until this table has at least one row, no functional leader can be
   assigned through the UI, and the dashboard's Reviewers grid stays empty.

   Fill in the names below with real Active Directory display names — the
   "givenName sn" pair the login flow puts in the JWT, e.g. 'Jane Smith' — and
   run this file. Getting a name wrong is harmless: it just shows up as an
   assignable reviewer nobody matches.

   This file is deliberately NOT run by the numbered sequence. Nothing here is
   required for the app to start.
